# MarginAnnotator
MarginAnnotator transforms two-dimensional tables with annotations in their margins into tidy tables. This only works if entire rows and columns in your tables share metadata you want to annotate with. I mostly use MarginAnnotator to save microwell plate annotations I quickly scribbled down in the lab. This way, they are saved directly in a format I can read into data science workflows, speeding up the technical part of high-throughput experiments.
