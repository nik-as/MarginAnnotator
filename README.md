# MarginAnnotator
MarginAnnotator transforms two-dimensional tables with annotations in their margins into tidy tables. This only works if entire rows and columns in your tables share metadata you want to annotate with. I mostly use MarginAnnotator to save microwell plate annotations I quickly scribbled down in the lab in a format I can directly read into data science workflows.
